            </p>
            <p>Because TBC IS NOT A LENDING PARTNER, we cannot ultimately decide whether or not you are approved for a
                loan. We also cannot determine or influence the amount of money you may receive from using our referral
                services. The operator of this web site will share the information you provide with participating
                lending partners, advertisers, networks and other partners who may or may not lend or issue credit.
                Providing your information on this web site does not guarantee that you will be chosen by a lending
                partner or approved for a loan. We do not act as agents, brokers, or representatives for any of our
                lending partner, and we do not endorse or charge you for any service or product. All information that we
                collect and share about you is in accordance with our Privacy Policy which we advise you to review
                before submitting any information using our form.</p>
            <p>Because each lending partner is different and TBC has no control over the rates and fees each lending
                partner charges, we urge you to carefully review the terms associated with the offer before accepting or
                declining. Please remember that you are never under any obligation to accept an offer from a lending
                partner and you can cancel the entire process at any time at your discretion. TBC cannot be held
                accountable for any charges or terms presented to you by a lending partner, and we are in no way
                responsible for any agreement between you and a lending partner. For details, questions or concerns
                regarding your short-term loan, please contact your lending partner directly. Please note that lending
                partner terms may vary, and lending partner may use different criteria to determine whether an applicant
                is eligible for a loan. Not all who submit a request for credit will be chosen by a lending partner or
                approved for loan. If you are not chosen by a lending partner in the participating lending partner
                network, your information may be offered to participating third party advertisers and generators for
                consideration.</p>
            <p>Some of the lending partner in our network might perform a credit check before making their decisions
                using the three major reporting bureaus like, TransUnion, Experian and Equifax, as well as other
                alternate sources of consumer information. In the end, your credit rating may be impacted by a
                particular lending partners actions. If you do not pay back your loan by the specified due date, your
                lending partner may choose to report this delinquency to one or more of the major credit bureaus, which
                could negatively affect your rating.</p>
            <p>Any of the information that you read on this website may be changed at any time without any prior notice.
                We can not guarantee that your submitted information will be provided to a lending partner or that a
                lending partner will approve you for a loan. Not all lending partner can provide up to $100,000. The
                loans that may be offered by a lending partner are expensive forms of credit and are intended to provide
                you with short-term financing to solve immediate financial needs and should not be considered a
                long-term solution. If you are having serious financial issues, it is often best to consult with a
                professional credit counselor.</p>
            <h4>Advertising Disclosures</h4>
            <p>TBC does not charge you any fees to submit a loan request, be connected with a lending partner, or to
                receive loan offers or quotes. If you receive a quote or a loan offer, the lending partner with which
                you may be connected is available to review its terms with you at no cost. It’s possible that the
                lending partner may require a fee to process your formal loan search and/or credit report, but until you
                agree to pay the lending partner any fee(s) or sign any loan agreements, you may shop with TBC at no
                cost.</p>
            <p>The offers that you might receive are from companies from which TBC receives compensation. This
                compensation may impact what offers you receive and how/where products appear on this site (including,
                for example, the order in which they appear). TBC does not include all lending partner available in the
                marketplace. If you are presented with an offer, carefully review the details before signing.</p>
            <p>The offers that appear are from companies which LoanQuo and its partners receive compensation. This
                compensation may influence the selection, appearance, and order of appearance of the offers listed
                below. However, this compensation also facilitates the provision by LoanQuo of certain services to you
                at no charge. The offers shown below do not include all financial services companies or all of their
                available product and service offerings.</p>
            <h4>Example Of Offer</h4>
            <p>If you borrow $5,000 on a 3 year repayment term and at a 10% APR, the monthly repayment will be $161.34.
                Total repayment will be $5,808.24. Total interest paid will be $808.24. APR Disclosure</p>
            <p>The Annual Percentage Rate is the rate at which your loan accrues interest. It is based upon the amount
                of your loan, cost of the loan, term of the loan, repayment amounts and timing of payments and payoff.
                By law, the lending partner and/or lending partner must show you the APR before you enter into the loan.
                States have laws limiting the APR that the lending partner and/or lending partner can charge you. Rates
                will vary based on your credit, loan size and whether collateral is provided, with the lowest rates
                available to customers with good credit on larger, secured loans. Minimum and maximum loan amounts and
                APR may vary according to state law and lending partner or partners. We recommend you read the lending
                partners and/or lending partner’s personal terms and conditions in full before proceeding for a personal
                loan.</p>
            <h4>Income Disclosure</h4>
            <p>Your yearly income before taxes, Alimony, child support, or separate maintenance is optional. Increase
                any non-taxable income by 25%.</p>
            <h4>Regarding Credit Pulls</h4>
            <p>I also grant Nationwide, and the potential lenders they identify, the authority to access my credit
                report through hard or soft inquiry and I understand that Nationwide and/or the lenders may hard or soft
                pull and view my credit report for up to 120 days after I execute this Agreement.</p>
            <h4>Regarding Class Action</h4>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that any and all disputes, controversies or claims of any nature, whether
                relating to this Agreement or otherwise, must be brought in your individual capacity, and not as a
                plaintiff or class action member in any purported class, consolidated, collective or representative
                proceeding. Accordingly, you hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claim or action as a plaintiff
                or class member in any purported class, consolidated, collective, private attorney general action, or
                representative proceeding relating to any disputes, controversies or claims arising out of this
                Agreement or any loan.</p>
